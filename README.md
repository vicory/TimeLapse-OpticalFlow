# TimeLapse-OpticalFlow

This repo currently consists of:
* Two small c++ programs: one for registering two images, one for interpolating between two registered images
* A python wrapper script to create a TimeLapse from a set of images

C++ build dependencies are ITK and OpenCV.

Locations of some programs/data are hard-coded in the Python wrapper, those will need to be changed depending on where its running.
